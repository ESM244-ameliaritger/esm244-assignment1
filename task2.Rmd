You only need to use one dataset to practice running PCA, creating a biplot, and interpreting the results. Whichever dataset you choose, create a finalized HTML (knitted from .Rmd) that can be included as a project on your blogdown site including: 

1. A useful descriptive introductory summary (3 - 4 sentences) that helps the audience understand the data (include a citation as necessary) and what youâ€™ll be exploring
2. All of your organized and well-annotated code (with warnings/messages hidden) used to wrangle then run PCA, then create a finalized PCA biplot that appears (with a caption) in your knitted HTML
3. A summary (bulletpoints are fine) pointing out some major takeaways from your PCA that can be gleaned from the biplot
4. You are also welcome to include a photo in the HTML to add some visual interest (not required for Task 2).
